# SQL-HACKERRANK
This repository contains the [**SQL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) queries I wrote using [**MYSQL**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp) in  [**hackerrank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) for the problems.

I'm also writing down some important syntaxes for SQL over here in this **README**, so it might be useful for quick reference.
You can also refer [this](https://www.w3schools.com/sql) site for understanding SQL quickly, as i will summarizing all syntaxes here using that site and my experience of writing queries in the coding platform.
